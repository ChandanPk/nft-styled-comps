STREET SHA TOKENS
Taking NFTs to the real world for the first time

Imagine roaming the streets of New York City and getting the rarest NFT
Yes, that is what this is about. 


There are two ways : 
Physical     -Find an SHA tokens QR that will be posted on the streets and scan it.
               (The QR will be posted by agents assigned by SHA tokens) 
Digital      -we will drop a link in sha tokens social media and you need to travel to a certain street or geolocation to access the ticket
               (if you have the link, the NFT will be unlocked when you reach the specific location)


NOTE - The NFTs which you will get here is the 2000 tokens which was held back from the entire collections
 which is not for sale
